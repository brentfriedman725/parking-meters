# **Car Project Design Document**
The goal of this project is to enable the user to veiw parking availability within a specified a minimum and maximum longitude and latitude.

This project is currently a MVP, and should be able to return some credible information on parking spot statuses based on ParkMobile API data.

I plan on implementing location based services by tracking the current location of the user and offering parking suggestions in the given region.

Later on, this application should integrate a map service with djikstra's algorithm to find the fastest route for the current lovation to a selected parking spot.

## **Phase 1: Hitting APIs**

Currently

This project utilizes the flexiblity of python and the request library.
